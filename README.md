Minesweeper
===========

Minesweeper implementation in both Elm and Typescript. Attempted to use webpack
to property package both, but I couldn't be bothered. Having trouble with the
loaders. W/e, I got it working under some conditions which is good enough for
this comparison.

Running the Games
-----------------

To run Typescript: `npm run dev`

To run Elm: `npm run dev-elm`

Once running, hit the appropriate port.
